Phase 0: Planning & Requirements Gathering
✅ Goals:
Define the core features of the system

Identify microservices and their boundaries

🧩 Modules (initial ideas):
User Service (Admin, Teacher, Student)

Authentication Service (Login, JWT, roles)

Student Management Service

Course/Subject Service

Classroom Scheduling Service

Grade/Report Service

Fee/Payments Service

Notification Service

Attendance Service

Parent Portal Service (optional)

🛠️ Phase 1: Setup and Tooling
🔧 Tasks:
 Create a Git repository and CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)

 Choose API communication strategy: REST (start), gRPC/EventBus (later)

 Install tools:

.NET 8 SDK

Docker

RabbitMQ (eventing)

PostgreSQL / SQL Server / MongoDB (pick one or mix)

Redis (optional caching)

 Set up solution structure:

│   ├── CourseService
│   ├── GradeService
│   └── ...
├── Shared
│   ├── Common (DTOs, Enums, Extensions)
│   └── EventBus (e.g., using MassTransit)
├── Gateway
│   └── API Gateway (Ocelot or YARP)
└── Infrastructure
    └── Logging, Monitoring, Config
🔐 Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization
🔒 AuthService:
 Register/Login endpoints

 JWT-based authentication

 Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent)

 Use IdentityServer or ASP.NET Core Identity

🎓 Phase 3: Core Domain Services
Each service should be a separate .NET project (microservice).

📘 StudentService
 Register student

 Get/Edit/Delete student

 Assign to classroom

🧑‍🏫 TeacherService
 Register teacher

 Assign teacher to subject/class

🗂️ CourseService
 Add/edit/delete courses

 Link courses to class & teacher

📅 ScheduleService
 Define class timetable

 Conflict-free scheduling logic

🧾 Phase 4: Supporting Features
📝 GradeService
 Enter/edit scores per student per subject

 Calculate GPA, grades

 Report generation

💸 PaymentService
 Track fees, dues

 Integrate payment gateway (Stripe, Paystack)

 Generate receipts

🕓 AttendanceService
 Mark daily student/teacher attendance

 Track absence rates

📣 NotificationService
 Send SMS/Email (via third-party API)

 Push messages for upcoming exams/events

🌐 Phase 5: Communication & Shared Infrastructure
🔁 API Gateway
 Use Ocelot or YARP to route requests to services

📨 Event-Driven Communication
 Integrate RabbitMQ or Kafka via MassTransit

 Use events like: StudentRegistered, GradeSubmitted, etc.

🛡️ Phase 6: Security, Validation & Monitoring
 Secure all endpoints (JWT validation)

 Validate input using FluentValidation

 Add rate-limiting, request logging

 Use Serilog, Seq, Prometheus, or Grafana for monitoring

📊 Phase 7: Admin Dashboard (Optional)
 ASP.NET Razor/Blazor OR Angular/React frontend

 Admin panels for:

Students, Teachers

Grades, Reports

Fee payment stats

✅ Final Touches
 Unit & Integration Testing with xUnit + Moq

 API documentation using Swagger

 Dockerize services

 Deploy to Azure / AWS / Render / DigitalOcean

 Write README with setup instructions
